    synopsis:
      "Silent Dominion is not just a dystopian narrative, it’s a chilling reflection on how easily the threads of freedom can be replaced with the cold calculus of control. At the center of this transformation is Silentium, a quantum mineral that has the potential to regulate societal order with mathematical precision. As the world governments embrace this new “solution,” citizens find themselves increasingly restricted, their actions and values determined by the cold efficiency of algorithms. Through Elena Marceau’s eyes, we see how the promises of equality and fairness are intertwined with the subtle erosion of personal autonomy. Silent Dominion is a powerful commentary on the delicate balance between governance and freedom.",

The book explores the intellectual and spiritual challenges zero presented, especially in Western societies where its very existence was seen as a threat to the established order. As the story of zero unfolds, readers are introduced to its power to unlock the infinite, turning mathematical abstractions into tangible concepts that define the universe itself.",

Collins delves into the Law of Expansion, which drives the soul to seek contrast, not to avoid it, but to grow through it.
